A person mind reads when he presumes to know, without direct evidence, what another is thinking or feeling. We do it often. It is sometimes an intuitive response to some non-verbal clues that we have noticed on an unconscious level. Often it is pure hallucination, or what we ourselves would think or feel in that situation: we project our own unconscious thoughts and feelings, and experience them as coming from the other person. It is always the miser who experiences other people as mean. People who mind read usually feel they are right, but this does not guarantee they are. Why guess when you can ask?
There are two main types of mind reading. In the first type a person presumes to know what another is thinking. Examples:
'George is unhappy.'
'I could tell she did not like the present I gave her.' 'I know what makes him tick.'
'He was angry but he wouldn't admit it.'
There needs to be good sensory-based evidence for attributing thoughts, feelings and opinions to others. You might say, 'George is depressed,' but it might be more useful to say, 'George is looking down to his right, his face muscles are slack and his breathing is shallow. The corners of his mouth are turned down and his shoulders are slumped.'
